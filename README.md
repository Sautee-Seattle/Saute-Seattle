# Sauté Seattle

A collaborative group project between [a Blaine Anderson](https://github.com/BlaineA97)


Ruby on Rails App
Amazon Web Services, S3, for hosting images of produce, profiles, etc.
Implements google’s map API to help us post locations of where to find produce.
Using these services provided a well-rounded user-experience.
This meant that a large portion of our project was dedicated to discovering how to integrate these services into our concept.
