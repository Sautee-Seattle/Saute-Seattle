# Sauté Seattle

Here at Saute' Seattle we strive to make it simple and easy to find out what is in season anytime & anywhere! We work hard to bring you only the most up to date information at all times. The creators of Saute' Seattle are all foodies who absolutely love food, coffee, cake, pizza, dim sum and more! Eating seasonally grown produce helps farmers, markets, and your health! so make sure you buy seasonally available produce whenever you have the chance.
